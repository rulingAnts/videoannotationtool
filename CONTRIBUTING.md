## Proposing a Major New Feature: Android App for Informants

The current version of this tool is designed for linguists on a computer. We have a vision for a major new feature that would empower native speakers to directly contribute to a research project with minimal technical overhead.

This new project would be a **standalone Android app** designed for a native-speaking informant. The goal is to make it as simple as possible for a user with limited tech savvy to record and submit video descriptions.

**Key Requirements for the Android App:**

  * **Zero-Configuration for the Informant:** The user should not have to manually configure cloud services, set folder locations, or manage files. All settings should be pre-configured by the researcher.
  * **Researcher-Bundled Content:** The researcher should be able to bundle a set of videos and configuration settings (e.g., Google Drive/Dropbox API keys, destination folders) with the app itself. The ideal end product would be a Windows or macOS wizard that creates this pre-configured package.
  * **Easy Interface:** The app should have a large, intuitive interface with clear buttons for watching a video and recording an audio description.
  * **Automated Uploads:** The app should automatically handle the upload of recordings to the designated cloud service without the user needing to manually log in or transfer files.
  * **Privacy and Non-Overwriting:** The app should use a user ID or device ID to ensure recordings are not overwritten by another user with the same app, providing a simple form of data protection and organization.

We are looking for a collaborator or a team to help us bring this vision to life. If you have experience with **Android development (Java/Kotlin)**, **cloud storage APIs (Google Drive, Dropbox)**, or **desktop GUI wizards (Python/Qt)**, please reach out by opening a new issue to discuss this proposal.

## Adding New Languages

If you want to add a new language, please create a new dictionary entry in the `LABELS_ALL` variable, formatted just like the existing ones. The key should be the language name in English, and the `language_name` value should be in the native language.

Thank you for your valuable contribution\!
