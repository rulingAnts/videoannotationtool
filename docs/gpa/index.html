      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Review tab runs quiz‑style sessions with fairness rules, per‑item timing, repetitions, grading, and YAML/grouped exports. It only quizzes items that have recordings.</p>
      <p>Below are three practical ways to use the app with GPA “Dirty Dozen” activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="default">
      <h2>Default: record after the session for independent review</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare your folders</strong> (images/videos) in advance and open them in the app.</li>
        <li>Meet with a native speaker and <strong>collect a small set of words/phrases</strong> using props, real‑world context, or paper notes.</li>
        <li>After the session, use the <em>Videos</em> and <em>Images</em> tabs to <strong>record a clean prompt/definition</strong> for each item. Each WAV will share the media filename.</li>
        <li>Open the <em>Review</em> tab and set <strong>repetitions to 3–5</strong>. Quiz yourself on the recorded items (the Review tab only shows items with recordings).</li>
        <li>Repeat until comfortable; add new items to your folder and record prompts, then review again.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Configure fairness rules, timing, and sounds in the Review header. Export session stats as YAML and use grouped export when needed.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="live">
      <h2>Alternate: train a partner during the session</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare and open your folders in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Record one word</strong> (Videos or Images tab), then switch to <em>Review</em> and quiz it (set reps to 3–5).</li>
        <li><strong>Add one new word</strong>, record it, then quiz the growing set in <em>Review</em>.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you reach <strong>twelve</strong> items (“Dirty Dozen”).</li>
        <li>Use this flow to help a native speaker partner <strong>see and practice</strong> the add‑one‑quiz process.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="limited">
      <h2>Alternate: maximize limited face‑time</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare a picture dictionary</strong> of the words you need to learn and open the folder in the app.</li>
        <li>When you have limited time with a native speaker, <strong>record prompts quickly</strong> for as many items as possible.</li>
        <li>Later, in the <em>Review</em> tab, use <strong>Items per Session</strong> to simulate Dirty Dozen: start with 2, quiz; then 3, quiz; then 4, etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Live, interactive activities with real‑world context are ideal. If that’s not feasible, this app helps you learn efficiently with limited access.</p>
