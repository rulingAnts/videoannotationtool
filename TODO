- [] Add a tab for a grid-view interface of still images (and the ability to click each and have a play/record modal/menu come up. For record, confirm overwrite. Recorded audio for images should include the file extension of the image file before .wav so that they don't overwrite the video recording.)

# FS Manager Integration Follow-ups
- [] Replace remaining `self.folder_path` references with `self.fs.current_folder` in `show_first_frame()`, `play_video()`, and any guards.
- [] Wire `imagesUpdated` signal to any still-image views when implemented.
- [] Migrate any direct `os.listdir` usage in UI to `FolderAccessManager` helpers where applicable.
- [] Investigate occasional playback segfault; add defensive checks around `cv2.VideoCapture` and lifecycle.
- [] Add unit-style smoke tests for FS manager flows (folder change, videosUpdated, metadata read/write).


Optional next step
I can finish converting show_first_frame() and play_video() guards that still reference self.folder_path and review any lingering direct filesystem calls. Want me to proceed?
