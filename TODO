# FS Manager Integration Follow-ups

 [x] Replace remaining `self.folder_path` references with `self.fs.current_folder` in `show_first_frame()`, `play_video()`, and any guards.
 [x] Standardize `JoinWavsWorker` to rely on `FolderAccessManager` (remove legacy `folder_path`).
 [] Wire `imagesUpdated` signal to any still-image views when implemented.
 [x] Migrate any direct `os.listdir` usage in UI to `FolderAccessManager` helpers where applicable.
 [x] Centralize Windows dotfile cleanup in `FolderAccessManager.cleanup_hidden_files()` and use it in UI.
 [] Investigate occasional playback segfault; gather logs and reproduce cases.
 [x] Add defensive checks around `cv2.VideoCapture` lifecycle (release on open failure).
 [x] Add unit-style smoke tests for FS manager flows (folder change, videosUpdated, metadata read/write).

# Logging
 [x] Switch to structured YAML logging with rotation (1MB, 3 backups).
 [] Add additional structured entries around OpenCV open/read failures to aid reproduction.

 [] Add a tab for a grid-view interface of still images (and the ability to click each and have a play/record modal/menu come up. For record, confirm overwrite. Recorded audio for images should include the file extension of the image file before .wav so that they don't overwrite the video recording.)
