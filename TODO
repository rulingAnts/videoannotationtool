[x] Visually distinguish video thumbnails from still image thumbnails somehow in Review tab.
[x] Consider adding a "Reset to Defaults" button in the Review settings UI to restore default settings easily.
[x] Fix the QThread: Destroyed while thread '' is still running error on app quit.

[x] Test randomness changes for smaller grids (like 2-3 items, etc) (especially test stability)
[ ] Fix full-screen play/preview functionality in Review tab for videos.
[x] Add ability to export current media into multiple separate folders in order to reduce it to manageable lessons (like if the user has too many in one folder).
[x] Try to see if you can reduce space between image thumbnails in the grid so that there's less whitespace?
[ ] Specify how YAML settings should be included in the exports (same as the session, except only one folder, but maybe if we're specifying how many items per session, that will be just fine??)
[ ] Test Export Sets and Export Results functionality more thoroughly.
[ ] Test settings YAML feature for the folder more thoroughly (loading different folders, etc).



# For a later release:
[ ] Add backward compatible convention of including video filenames in matching wav filenames.

# FS Manager Integration Follow-ups

 [x] Replace remaining `self.folder_path` references with `self.fs.current_folder` in `show_first_frame()`, `play_video()`, and any guards.
 [x] Standardize `JoinWavsWorker` to rely on `FolderAccessManager` (remove legacy `folder_path`).
 [] Wire `imagesUpdated` signal to any still-image views when implemented.
 [x] Migrate any direct `os.listdir` usage in UI to `FolderAccessManager` helpers where applicable.
 [x] Centralize Windows dotfile cleanup in `FolderAccessManager.cleanup_hidden_files()` and use it in UI.
 [] Investigate occasional playback segfault; gather logs and reproduce cases.
 [x] Add defensive checks around `cv2.VideoCapture` lifecycle (release on open failure).
 [x] Add unit-style smoke tests for FS manager flows (folder change, videosUpdated, metadata read/write).

# Logging
 [x] Switch to structured YAML logging with rotation (1MB, 3 backups).
 [] Add additional structured entries around OpenCV open/read failures to aid reproduction.

 [] Add a tab for a grid-view interface of still images (and the ability to click each and have a play/record modal/menu come up. For record, confirm overwrite. Recorded audio for images should include the file extension of the image file before .wav so that they don't overwrite the video recording.)
